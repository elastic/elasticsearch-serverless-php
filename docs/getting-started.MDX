This page guides you through the installation process of the Serverless PHP 
client, shows you how to instantiate the client, and how to perform basic 
Elasticsearch operations with it.


## Requirements

* PHP 8.0 or higher installed on your system.


## Installation


### Using the command line

You can install the Elasticsearch Serverless PHP client using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
with the following commands:

```bash
composer require elastic/elasticsearch-serverless

```


## Instantiate a client

You can instantiate a client by running the following command:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Elastic\Elasticsearch\Serverless\ClientBuilder;

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
  ->setEndpoint('<elasticsearch-endpoint>')
  ->setApiKey('<api-key>')
  ->build();
```

You can find the Elasticsearch endpoint URL and API Key on the **Getting started** page
in the **Project** cloud management page.

## Using the API

After you instantiated a client with your API key and Elasticsearch endpoint, 
you can start ingesting documents into the Elasticsearch Service. You can use 
the Bulk API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete several 
documents in one request.


### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of actions (index)
and documents.

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books` 
index:

```php
$body = [
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "Snow Crash", "author" => "Neal Stephenson", "release_date" => "1992-06-01", "page_count" => 470],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "Revelation Space", "author" => "Alastair Reynolds", "release_date" => "2000-03-15", "page_count" => 585],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "1984", "author" => "George Orwell", "release_date" => "1949-06-08", "page_count" => 328],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "Fahrenheit 451", "author" => "Ray Bradbury", "release_date" => "1953-10-15", "page_count" => 227],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "Brave New World", "author" => "Aldous Huxley", "release_date" => "1932-06-01", "page_count" => 268],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "The Handmaid's Tale", "author" => "Margaret Atwood", "release_date" => "1985-06-01", "page_count" => 311]
];

$response = $client->bulk(body: $body);
# You can check the response if the items are indexed and have an ID
print_r($response['items']);

```

When you use the client to make a request to Elasticsearch, it returns an API 
response object. THis object implements the [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) interface,
that means you can check the for the HTTP status using the following method:

```php
print($response->getStatusCode());
```

or get the HTTP response headers using the following:

```php
print_r($response->getHeaders());
```

or reading the HTTP response body as follows:

```php
print($response->getBody()->getContents());
# or using the asString() dedicated method
print($response->asString());
``

Moreover, the response body can be accessed as associative array or as object.

```php
var_dump($response['items']); # associative array
var_dump($response->items);   # object
```

We provide also three methods to render the response as array, object, string
and boolean values.

```php
var_dump($response->asArray());  // response body content as array
var_dump($response->asObject()); // response body content as object
var_dump($response->asString()); // response body as string (JSON)
var_dump($response->asBool());   // true if HTTP response code between 200 and 300
```

### Searching

Now that some data is available, you can search your documents using the 
**Search API**:

```php
# Search for all the books written by Ray Bradbury
$query = [ 'query' => [ 'match' => [ 'author' => 'Ray Bradbury' ]]];
$response = $client->search(index: "books", body: $query);

printf("Documents found: %d\n", $response['hits']['total']['value']); # total documents found
print_r($response['hits']['hits']); # list of books
```

For more information about the Search query parameters and the response type
you can refer to the [Search API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html)
documentation page of Elasticsearch.

### Updating a document

You can call the `update` API to update a document:

```php
$id = '<insert the document ID>';
# update the "page_count" value to 300
$body = [ "doc" => [ "page_count" => 300 ]];
$response = $client->update(index: "books", id: $id, body: $body);
printf("Operation result: %s\n", $response['result']); # You should read 'updated' as result
```

### Deleting a document

You can call the `delete` API to delete a document:

```php
$id = '<insert the document ID>';
$response = $client->delete(index: "books", id: $id);
printf("Operation result: %s\n", $response['result']); # You should read "deleted" as result
```

If you try to get the document ID, you will get a `ClientResponseException` with a `404 Not Found`
message, as follows:

```php
use Elastic\Elasticsearch\Serverless\Exception\ClientResponseException;

$id = '<insert the document ID>';
try {
    $response = $client->get(index: "books", id: $id);
} catch (ClientResponseException $e) {
    printf("The document does not exist: %s\n", $e->getMessage());
    printf("HTTP status code: %d\n", $e->getResponse()->getStatusCode());
}
printf("Operation result: %s\n", $response['result']); # You should read "deleted" as result
```

### Deleting an index

You can delete an entire index as follows:

```php
$response = $client->indices()->delete(index: "books");
if ($response['acknowledged']) {
    print("Index successfully removed!");
}
```

This operation is possible only if the associated API key has `delete_index`
or [manage index privilege](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices)
for the target index.
