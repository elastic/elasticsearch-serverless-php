# Elasticsearch Serverless Client

[![main](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-serverless-php/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-serverless-php/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This is the official Elastic client for the **Elasticsearch Serverless** service. If you're looking to develop your PHP application with the Elasticsearch Stack, you should look at the [Elasticsearch Client](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php) instead. If you're looking to develop your PHP application with Elastic Enterprise Search, you should look at the [Enterprise Search Client](https://github.com/elastic/enterprise-search-php/).

## Installation

You can install the library using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) with the following command:

```bash
composer require elastic/elasticsearch-serverless
```

You need specify the version, if you want to install an `aplha` or `rc` release, as follows:

```bash
composer require elastic/elasticsearch-serverless:0.1.0-alpha1
```

Please remember that `alpha` releases are quite unstable, the code can change between releases.
Instead, a release candidate `rc` will not break the backward compatibility but with the possibility
of having bugs to be fixed.

### Instantiate a Client

When you have installed elasticsearch-php you can start using it with the `Client`` class.
You can use the ClientBuilder class to create this object:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Elastic\Elasticsearch\Serverless\ClientBuilder;

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
  ->setEndpoint('<elasticsearch-endpoint>')
  ->setApiKey('<api-key>')
  ->build();

# $client is an object of Elastic\Elasticsearch\Serverless\Client class
```


### Usage

You can read to the [official documentation](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless/elasticsearch/php-client-getting-started) 
page for a getting started guide.
